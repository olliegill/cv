     <h1>Work Experience</h1>
     <h2>July 2002 - October 2008</h2>
     <h3>Morrisons PLC</h3>
     <h4>Various roles</h4>
     <p>I started this job at 16 for some extra money during my A Levels and University. It also meant my hours could be flexible so I could tour and play shows with my bands and do extracurricular courses.</p>
     <p>I learned the ins and outs of large businesses, and completed my degree's year in industry in the financial offices.</p>

     <h2>August 2002 - October 2007</h2>
     <h3>Guitarist in two bands.</h3>
     <p>We started a band in high school, picked up a local following and took ourselves around the country as much as we could.</p>
     <p>Thinking back, it's amazing how many skills I picked up through necessity, like social media management, budgeting skills, dealing with difficult promoters/clients and working intensely in a small group, making creative and logistical decisions</p>

     <h2>October 2008 - August 2014</h2>
     <h3>Morrisons PLC</h3>
     <h4>Assistant Regional Financial Officer</h4>
     <p>I was head of a small team that made sure a number of grocery stores finances were in order.</p>
     <p>My main role was basically a fixer for all kinds of problems and situations. Everyday was a different challenge, from huge security issues to day to day upkeep of the systems.</p>
