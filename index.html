     <h1>Work Experience</h1>
     <h2>July 2002 - October 2008</h2>
     <h3>Morrisons PLC</h3>
     <h4>Various roles</h4>
     <p>I started this job at 16 for some extra money during my A Levels and University. It also meant my hours could be flexible so I could tour and play shows with my bands and do extracurricular courses.</p>
     <p>I learned the ins and outs of large businesses, and completed my degree's year in industry in the financial offices.</p>

     <h2>August 2002 - October 2007</h2>
     <h3>Guitarist in two bands.</h3>
     <p>We started a band in high school, picked up a local following and took ourselves around the country as much as we could.</p>
     <p>Thinking back, it's amazing how many skills I picked up through necessity, like social media management, budgeting skills, dealing with difficult promoters/clients and working intensely in a small group, making creative and logistical decisions.</p>

     <h2>October 2008 - August 2014</h2>
     <h3>Morrisons PLC</h3>
     <h4>Assistant Regional Financial Officer</h4>
     <p>I was head of a small team that made sure a number of grocery stores finances were in order.</p>
     <p>My main role was basically a fixer for all kinds of problems and situations. Everyday was a different challenge, from huge security issues to day to day upkeep of the systems.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="about">
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I have very strong written and verbal communication skills, I'm an excellent team player, I thrive in problem solving situations. I'm just as comfortable in either creative or practical situations. I have a keen eye for detail and I'm a very fast learner, highly motivated and I bring a light-hearted, fresh, motivational approach to the workplace.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding I love writing, playing and appreciating music, reading books, especially maths history and English language books, getting lost on long bike rides and playing Scrabble over a beer. I'm also a big sports guy, but sometimes I get lost in the stats more than the game itself.</p>
    <p>I love making friends with awesome people, travelling and eating all of the world's food.</p>
